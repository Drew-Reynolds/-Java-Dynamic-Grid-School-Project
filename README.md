This was a school project about creating our own array class that grew and shrank dynamically to save more time than a normal array. The assignment had three major parts:

1. DynamicArray.java: Create a DynamicArray object that has a size and capacity. Whenever the capacity is full, double the size of the array. Whenever the capacity is less than or equal to 1/3, shrink to half of the capacity.

2. DynamicGrid.java: Create a 2D array of the previous DynamicArray object, with the same rules on capacity.

3. Create a table using a DynamicGrid object and 2 DynamicArray objects as its headers. The headers will fill out the spaces in the DynamicGrid.

The result can be seen in GUI.java, with a 2D array of colors based on HEX codes in the headers.

Check out DynamicArray.java, DynamicGrid.java, Table.java and GUI.java to see the results. Anything not authored by Drew Reynolds was fully made by the instructor. The instructor also made the method headers and instructions for the ones authored by me.
